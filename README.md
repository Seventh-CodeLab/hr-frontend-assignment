## Hurtigruten frontend assignment

This project allows Hurtigruten to asses potential frontend candidates with real, working code.

You will find the exercises in the [exercises.md](./exercises.md) file.

We don't expect you to use more than **5 hours** on this. If you're not finished after the time limit that's fine, just submit what you've got.

We have bootstrapped this assignment with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to give you the initial setup.

**If you feel strongly about using other frameworks (such as [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)), libraries or tools you are free to do so!**

# Solution: Krister P. Emanuelsen
As instructed by our contact at Experis, I've limited the solution to only cover tasks 1 and 2, and spent only around 1 hour completing those requirements. (Not including time spent writing comments and readme)

I added a library called Styled Components into the project to simplify styling and collect most of the code in the same files.

ALL of my changes in this soluction can be found in the following files:

- `src/components/SearchForm.tsx`
- `src/App.tsx`
- `package.json`

I have documented a very brief explanation in the comments in `SearchForm.tsx` covering HOW I would go about solving tasks 3, 4, and 5 given more time to work on the task.

Thank you for letting me participate in this assignment! :)
